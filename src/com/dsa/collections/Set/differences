differences between list,set

- Lists allow duplicate elements, while sets do not allow duplicate elements.

- Elements in lists are ordered and can be accessed by index, whereas elements in sets are not ordered (except for LinkedHashSet) and cannot be accessed by index.

- Implementations of lists include ArrayList, LinkedList, and Vector, while implementations of sets include HashSet, TreeSet, and LinkedHashSet.

- Lists are commonly used when elements need to be stored in a specific sequence, whereas sets are preferred when uniqueness of elements is important and order is not relevant.

- Operations such as add, get, set, remove, and iteration are commonly performed on lists, while operations such as add, remove, contains, and iteration are common for sets.

differences between HashSet,TreeSet,LinkedHashSet


- HashSet:

  - Does not allow duplicate elements.
  
  - Elements are not ordered and cannot be accessed by index.
  
  - Uses hashing mechanism to store elements.
  
  - Provides constant-time performance for basic operations (add, remove, contains).
  
  - Implementation does not guarantee the order of elements.



- TreeSet:

  - Does not allow duplicate elements.
  
  - Elements are sorted in natural order or according to a comparator provided at the time of creation.
  
  - Provides performance logarithmic time cost for basic operations (add, remove, contains).
  
  - Suitable for scenarios where elements need to be sorted.
  
  - Implementation maintains the elements in sorted order.




- LinkedHashSet:

  - Does not allow duplicate elements.
  
  - Maintains the insertion order of elements.
  
  - Provides constant-time performance for basic operations (add, remove, contains).
  
  - Implemented as a hash table with a linked list running through it, hence providing the insertion-order iteration.
  
  - Suitable for scenarios where both uniqueness and insertion order of elements are important.
